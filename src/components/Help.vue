           Honesty is the best policy. If you want someone to take your job offering seriously, Be honest
And up front about the details. If you have never hired someone with that particular skillset,
Be respectful of their skills and don’t waste their time.

            Employers may post a review of workers either good or bad but should only do so if they have
Actually hired them. The whole purpose of Specialty Stars is to establish a good fit between
workers and employers by giving employers a chance to screen workers first.

              Post a reasonable rate of Compensation. If your rate of
              compensation does not match your experience level, No one will
              contact you. Remember that once you have shown your employer what
              you can do, you can always ask for more money. It’s best to get
              your foot in the door!

              Keep the baggage to a minimum! Remember that employers want to
              hire you and only you! If you’re only available 1 day a week and
              you need to bring your brother and your cousin with you, Don’t be
              surprised if no one wants to hire you!
